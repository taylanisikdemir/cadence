# Data Race Fix Summary

## Issue
There was a data race in the leader election tests, specifically in `TestElector_Run_Resign`. The race condition occurred between:
- **Goroutine 29**: Test cleanup code (testing framework)
- **Goroutine 31**: Election goroutine still running and trying to log

## Root Cause
The election goroutine was continuing to run and attempt logging even after the test had finished and the test context was being cleaned up. This caused a race condition where:

1. The test would finish and start cleanup
2. The election goroutine would still be running in the background
3. Both goroutines would access the same memory location (test logger) simultaneously
4. This resulted in the data race warning at line 149 in `election.go`

## Stack Trace Analysis
The stack trace showed:
- **Read**: Election goroutine trying to log "Adding random delay before campaigning" 
- **Write**: Test framework cleaning up test resources
- **Location**: `election.go:149` - the Debug logging statement in `runElection`

## Solution
Applied a two-part fix to `service/sharddistributor/leader/election/election.go`:

### 1. Early Context Check
Added a context check at the beginning of `runElection()` to prevent the function from proceeding if the context is already canceled:

```go
// Check if context is already canceled before proceeding
if ctx.Err() != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("context cancelled before election: %w", ctx.Err())
}
```

### 2. Remove Logging on Context Cancellation
Removed the logging statement when the context is canceled in the main election loop to prevent "logged too late" warnings:

```go
// Check if parent context is already canceled
if runCtx.Err() != nil {
    // Context is canceled, exit immediately without logging
    return
}
```

## Testing
- The `TestElector_Run_Resign` test now passes without data race warnings
- All other tests in the election package continue to pass
- No "logged too late" warnings are generated

## Impact
This fix ensures that:
1. The election goroutine terminates immediately when the context is canceled
2. No logging occurs after the test has finished
3. The data race condition is eliminated
4. Test reliability is improved

The fix is minimal and focused, addressing only the specific race condition without changing the overall behavior of the election system.
